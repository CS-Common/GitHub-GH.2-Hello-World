## Overview

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png" align="right"> Today you are going to create an account on [GitHub][] (contol-click on this link to open it in another tab) one of the better known sites for hosting [Git][] repositories. Git is a _source code management_ system – a tool to help keep track of the change in software projects, like Unity games. When things go wrong, git can help you figure out what changed, and who change it. That's the first step towards fixing it.

Here is an overview of what you will be doing today:

* Create an account on GitHub.
* Practice working with Git and GitHub.
* Turn on the [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] web site – we'll use this later to host our games.
* Practice by making a few changes to your website.

To finish this assignment you will need a working e-mail account that you can access. If you alread have one, that's great, use it. Otherwise, you will need to set one up. Until you verify your e-mail address, your GitHub Pages site will not be active. You can do everything else without a working e-mail.

## First Things First

In order to complete this assignment:

1. Make sure you have a working e-mail account where you can check your e-mail.
1. Complete the GitHub account setup assignment.

## The Details:

Here's what to do, in detail:

### Practice working with Git and GitHub

At the [GitHub Guides][gh-guides] site you will find a number of quick tutorials that will help you start to learn your way around Git and GitHub.

1. Read the [Understanding the GitHub Flow][gh-flow] guide.
1. Then work through the [Hello World][hello-world] guide.
1. After you have finishe the Hello World guide, click on your GitHub bookmark to return to your profile and notice that you have some new [contribution squares][gh-squares] (you should have at least five).
1. Click on your Hello World repository and you should see that you have, at least, three commits.

Congratulations, you're rolling! Next, we'll set up a website.

## Submit The Assignment

When you are done, submit the assignment:

* Click on your GitHub bookmark to take you to your GitHub profile, then copy the URL.
* On Canvas (you're here, right?) paste the URL into the submission box.
* Finally in your notebook, reflect on how it went today:
  - Select the next blank page and date it and title it "Starting GitHub" would not be a bad choice of title for today.
  - What is something that "clicked" for your? Perhaps, how do you think we might use Git and GitHub on our final project?
  - Did you get stuck or lost today? Where? Do you know why?
  - What do you need to do next?
